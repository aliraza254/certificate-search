# certificate-search

Introducing Certificate Search, the ultimate WordPress plugin for managing and accessing certificates with ease. With this plugin, you can effortlessly add and search data through a custom field powered by Advanced Custom Fields (ACF).

Certificate Search offers two types of data: free and paid. Users can search for specific certificates using serial numbers or certificate numbers, retrieving relevant information instantly. If users require access to additional data, they can purchase a subscription product seamlessly integrated with WooCommerce.

To ensure data integrity and security, the plugin includes a validation feature. After one year of subscription, users will need to renew their subscription to continue accessing paid data. This ensures that only authorized users can view and benefit from the valuable information stored in the certificates.

Empower your website with Certificate Search and provide your users with a hassle-free way to manage and retrieve their certificates. Whether it's for personal or professional use, this plugin streamlines the process, saving time and effort. Upgrade your certificate management system today and unlock a world of possibilities with Certificate Search.
